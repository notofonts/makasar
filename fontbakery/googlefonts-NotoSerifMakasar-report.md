* üî• **FAIL** The following glyph names do not comply with naming conventions: i_i-makasar and u_u-makasar

 A glyph name must be entirely comprised of characters from the following set: A-Z a-z 0-9 .(period) _(underscore). A glyph name must not start with a digit or period. There are a few exceptions such as the special glyph ".notdef". The glyph names "twocents", "a1", and "_" are all valid, while "2cents" and ".twocents" are not. [code: found-invalid-names]

* üî• **FAIL** Space and non-breaking space have differing width: The space glyph named space is 200 font units wide, non-breaking space named (nbspace) is 260 font units wide, and both should be positive and the same. GlyphsApp has "Sidebearing arithmetic" (https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/spacing) which allows you to set the non-breaking space width to always equal the space width. [code: different-widths]

* ‚ö† **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

	- Glyph name: aogonek	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2

	- Glyph name: Uogonek	Contours detected: 2	Expected: 1

	- Glyph name: uogonek	Contours detected: 2	Expected: 1

	- Glyph name: Uogonek	Contours detected: 2	Expected: 1

	- Glyph name: aogonek	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2 

	- And Glyph name: uogonek	Contours detected: 2	Expected: 1
